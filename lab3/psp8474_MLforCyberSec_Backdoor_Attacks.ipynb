        "BadNets refer to instances where neural networks, designed for specific tasks like image recognition or natural language processing, have been compromised or manipulated to produce inaccurate or malicious outputs. These alterations can stem from intentional tampering by adversaries, unintentional biases in the training data, or even faults in the network architecture. Such compromised models can pose significant risks, potentially leading to misclassification, security vulnerabilities, or unreliable decision-making in critical applications. Addressing and mitigating the emergence of BadNets demands robust security protocols, thorough model validation, diverse dataset curation, and continuous monitoring to ensure the integrity and reliability of AI systems.\n",
